🧠 Objective
To develop a responsive and intelligent dashboard that displays real-time image restoration alongside environmental sensor data and analytical insights. This platform is designed to support monitoring, automatic parameter adjustments, and actionable feedback for enhanced performance in real-world driving scenarios.

✨ Features
📸 1. Real-Time Image Restoration Feed
Side-by-Side Visualization: Displays input, deteriorated, and restored images for immediate comparison.

Quality Metrics Overlay: Shows SSIM, PSNR, and perceptual loss scores in real-time.

Attention Heatmap: Highlights the regions the model focuses on during restoration.

🌐 2. Sensor Integration and Environmental Data
Integrated Sensors:

Light Sensor – Detects ambient lighting conditions (e.g., fog, night).

Temperature Sensor – Monitors temperature impact on camera behavior.

Humidity Sensor – Assesses environmental moisture (e.g., rain, fog).

Real-Time Dashboard View:

Continuous sensor readings.

Visual alerts for challenging conditions.

Auto-Adjustment Alerts:

Real-time feedback when the model adjusts parameters (e.g., activates "low-light" mode).

📊 3. Restoration Statistics and Analytics
Frame Processing Time: Tracks average restoration time per frame.

Error Rate Monitoring: Identifies frames with restoration difficulties (e.g., unreadable text).

Fidelity Scores: Measures image clarity, color accuracy, and other restoration benchmarks.

Historical Analysis:

Trends over time and varying weather conditions.

Threshold Alerts:

Notifies users when performance dips below expected standards.

🔧 4. Automated Model Adaptation and Configuration
Auto-Mode Switching: Adjusts model settings based on sensor data.

Manual Override Panel:

Lets users tweak brightness, contrast, and filter strengths.

Adaptive Learning Log:

Tracks auto-adjustment decisions and outcomes for model improvement.

📁 5. Incident Reporting and Logging
Event Detection: Flags anomalies like unreadable road signs.

Data Logging:

Saves raw, degraded, and restored images with metadata.

Exportable Reports:

Summarizes restoration quality, triggered adjustments, and environmental context.
